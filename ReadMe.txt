This is an old version of a Sage script which computes generalized jet schemes. This has no reduction capability. 

The author may include more files and updates later. The code can be improved; however, since this sage script calls SINGULAR commands and procedures at crucial junctures, it is probably best to continue to develop in SINGULAR with arc.lib

arc.lib is significantly faster and more robust than this implementation. For example, one can do jet schemes of curves over order 100 in arc.lib whereas order over 20 is unreachable on a standard computer using NFT.py
